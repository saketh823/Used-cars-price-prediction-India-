# Used-cars-price-prediction-India-Dataset
The used cars price prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as car brand, model, fuel type, transmission type, mileage, and year of manufacture. 
The dataset used for this project contains information about different types of cars and their prices, which were sold in India.
The project involves performing data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and model development. 
The goal is to build an accurate and robust machine-learning model that can predict the prices of used cars with high precision and accuracy. 
The project can be beneficial for both buyers and sellers of used cars as it provides a reliable way to estimate the prices of used cars and make informed decisions.
